Consider changing name of Body section to Rules, but not sure it's really a good change because the
object in the Head section are "rules" too.

    There are two types of qualifiers: Header qualifiers appear in the Header section of the block
    and pertain to all rules in the block body. Rule qualifiers appear in the Body section of the
    block and pertain only to the rule with which they are associated.

  So “rule” covers a multitude of sins. But Header and Body are Proper Terms in the docs.


MaxPassFail in Head applies to all courses in the scribe block
MaxPassFail in the Body (i.e. in a rule) applies to courses in a course list

The implication is that there are two different types of course lists: head and body. But a single
build_course_list function can handle both; it's just the .g4 that has to be fixed so MaxPassFail
is not attached to a course_list in the head.
It's a mess; course lists are attached to various objects, so the distinction between head and body
has to be made at the higher-level context.

I had the following objects in both the head and body sections
  class_credit
  maxperdisc
  minclass
  minperdisc

Items that can have different meanings in head and body according to the docs:
  AllBlocks     Scope of ShareWith qualifier
  And           Logical op in IF; connect classes AND credits; list_op in course list
  At            Followed by a location (campus)
  Classes       Course list not allowed in header. Docs say same for body, but that’s wrong.
  College       Not used at CUNY(?)
  Conc          “When Conc is used in ShareWith, Blocktype, or Block it refers to the Conc block.
                When used in an If-statement it refers to the concentration on the student’s
                curriculum.”
  Credits       Like classes, including the documentation error.
  Decide        “you have up to nine ways to tell the auditor how to distinguish one class as being
                more valuable than another”
  Degree        ShareWith or if expression symbol
  DontShare     In Body, it’s a list qualifier
  Libl          “When Libl is used in ShareWith it refers to the Libl block in the audit. When used
                in an If-statement it refers to the liberal learning on the student’s curriculum.”
