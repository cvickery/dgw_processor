Consider changing name of Body section to Rules, but not sure it's really a good change because the
object in the Head section are "rules" too.

MaxPassFail in Head applies to all courses in the scribe block
MaxPassFail in the Body (i.e. in a rule) applies to courses in a course list
The implication is that there are two different types of course lists: head and body. But a single
build_course_list function can handle both; it's just the .g4 that has to be fixed so MaxPassFail
is not attached to a course_list in the head.
It's a mess; course lists are attached to various objects, so the distinction between head and body
has to be made at the higher-level context.

I had the following objects in both the head and body sections
  class_credit
  maxperdisc
  minclass
  minperdisc

Other items that can have different meanings in head and body according to the docs:
  maxtransfer - in head it can follow either a course list or just a list of symbols; in body it can be attached to a course list
  minclasses
  mincredits

Course list qualifiers that appear only in Body:
